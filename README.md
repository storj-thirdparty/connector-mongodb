## Overview

The mongoDB Connector connects to an mongoDB database, takes a backup of the specified database and uploads the backup data on Storj network. It can also restore the latest back-up of a specified database to the local storage.

```bash
Usage:
  connector-mongodb [command] <flags>

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  restore	  Command to restore the latest back-up to the local disk
  store       Command to upload data to a Storj V3 network
  version     Prints the version of the tool

```

`store` - Connect to the specified database (default: `db_property.json`). Back-up of the database is generated using tooling provided by mongoDB and then uploaded to the Storj network. Connect to a Storj v3 network using the access specified in the Storj configuration file (default: `storj_config.json`). 

 Back-up data is iterated through and upload in 1 MB chunks to the Storj network.

The following flags  can be used with the `store` command:

* `accesskey` - Connects to the Storj network using a serialized access key instead of an API key, satellite url and encryption passphrase.
* `share` - Generates a restricted shareable serialized access with the restrictions specified in the Storj configuration file.

`restore` - Connect to a Storj v3 network using the access specified in the Storj configuration file (default: `storj_config.json`). Latest back-up of the particular database is located and downloaded to local storage. 

The following flags  can be used with the `restore` command:

* `accesskey` - Connects to the Storj network using a serialized access key instead of an API key, satellite url and encryption passphrase.
* `match` - Matches to regular expression with the databases whose back-up(s) are uplaoded to Storj network and restores the latest back-up of all the matching databases. It only works with the `latest` flag.
* `latest` - Restores the latest back-up of the specified MongoDB database.
* `database` - Storj path of the database back-up to be restored. Takes only database name if used with `latest` flag.

Sample configuration files are provided in the `./config` folder.
